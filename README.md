# iL

iL (codenamed "Issual") is a Todo Manager with nothing special. The name "iL"
does not hold any special meanings, it's just a meaningless name for a course
design homework.

This project is not tested with iOS devices, and should only be run on Android.
I'd be appreciated if _someone_ would like to test and release an iOS version
of it.

## Feature

- Regular todo items managing
- Categorizing todo items
- Adding multiple state to items. Currently avaliable ones are: Open, Closed,
  Active, Pending, Canceled. User addition Soon™.
